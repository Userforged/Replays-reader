    "TOURNAMENT MATCH\n",

    "4. **Match Structure**: Either ≥2 sets OR 1 set with ≥3 rounds (special case)\n",

    "## 2. Detection Challenges & Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 1: OCR Gaps During Transitions\n",
    "**Problem**: Between rounds, camera shows replays/analysis → no timer/character detection  \n",
    "**Example**: LUKE vs DEE JAY match (00:14:00-00:19:15) was filtered out\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Timer Pattern Coherency\n",
    "- Don't rely on continuous detection\n",
    "- Look for timer \"reset\" patterns (low value → high value)\n",
    "- Allow gaps in detection as long as character context continues\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 2: Timer Start Value Variations\n",
    "**Problem**: Rounds don't always start exactly at 99 due to detection timing  \n",
    "**Example**: Timer detected at 97, 96, or 85 depending on when OCR catches it\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Flexible Threshold System\n",
    "- Original: Only accept timer starts ≥90\n",
    "- Improved: Accept timer starts ≥80 with different confidence levels\n",
    "- Detect significant jumps (>20 points) as potential round starts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 3: Real Start Time Calculation\n",
    "**Problem**: If timer detected at value X, when did the round actually start?  \n",
    "**Example**: Timer shows 89 at 00:05:30 → round started when?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Reverse Timer Calculation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# If detected timer=89 at 00:05:30\n",
    "seconds_elapsed_since_99 = 99 - 89  # = 10 seconds\n",
    "real_start_time = detection_time - elapsed - 1  # 00:05:30 - 10s - 1s = 00:05:19\n",

    "## 3. Architecture Design Decisions\n",

    "\n",
    "**Reasoning**: \n",

    "- Sets emerge from character consistency\n",
    "- Matches emerge from temporal grouping\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision 2: Validation at Each Level\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Round validation: timer coverage + decreasing pattern + reasonable start value\n",

    "# Match validation: minimum 2 sets OR 1 set with 3+ rounds\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "### Decision 3: Timer Pattern Types\n",

    "# Type 1: Classic transition (low <50 → high ≥90)\n",
    "# Type 2: Moderate jump (low <80 → medium ≥85) \n",

    "### Key Success Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Domain Knowledge**: Understanding SF6 game mechanics was crucial\n",
    "2. **Iterative Improvement**: Started strict, became flexible based on real data\n",
    "3. **Hierarchical Validation**: Bottom-up approach (rounds → sets → matches)\n",
    "4. **Pattern Recognition**: Timer coherency over rigid time-based rules\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modular Design**: Each detection level can be improved independently\n",
    "- **Configurable Thresholds**: Easy to tune for different video qualities\n",
    "- **Debug Visibility**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting\n",
    "- **Statistical Validation**: Built-in metrics to assess detection quality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Value\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automated Tournament Analysis**: Convert hours of video into structured data\n",
    "- **Statistical Insights**: Match duration, character usage, tournament flow\n",
    "- **Quality Assurance**: Detect incomplete or problematic tournament segments\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Process multiple tournaments with consistent methodology\n",
